## What exactly is computer graphics?
Computer graphics encompasses a captivating and multifaceted domain that revolves around the generation, manipulation, and rendering of visual content through computational means. Its scope spans from rudimentary 2D images to intricate 3D models, finding wide-ranging applications across diverse industries and technologies.

At its core, computer graphics harnesses computational power to produce visual representations of data, comprising geometric attributes of objects, textures for surface details, lighting conditions to emulate real-world illumination, and other essential elements crucial for immersive visual experiences. Rendering, a fundamental facet of computer graphics, entails transforming raw data into images suitable for display on screens or reproduction on print media. This process entails simulating light interactions with objects, materials, and environments to engender realistic or stylized imagery.

The term "CG," often utilized as an abbreviation for "computer graphics," has become integral to modern life, permeating entertainment, education, and design domains. Notably, video games leverage computer graphics to create interactive virtual realms. In the realm of filmmaking, CG significantly contributes to visual effects, bringing fantastical beings, awe-inspiring landscapes, and captivating sequences to cinematic fruition. Beyond entertainment, computer graphics finds utility in architecture, engineering, medicine, and scientific visualization. Architects deploy CG to engender realistic 3D models of structures and environments, facilitating client visualization. Engineers employ CG for complex system simulations and product design. Medicine benefits from CG for anatomical visualizations and surgical simulations, bolstering healthcare comprehension.

The profound technological strides witnessed in computer graphics have been remarkable. From rudimentary wireframe models to contemporary photorealistic imagery, advancements have been astounding. Real-time rendering and virtual reality have extended the possibilities for creativity and innovation. Aspiring enthusiasts can access diverse resources, encompassing books, online courses, open-source software, and interactive platforms, to acquire proficiency in various aspects of CG, be it shader programming, rendering algorithms, or scene composition.

## Fun Facts
* **The First CGI in a Movie: The first use of CGI in a movie was in the 1973 film "Westworld," where a computer-generated hand was used for a brief scene.**

* **The First Full-Length CGI Movie: "Toy Story" (1995) was the first full-length feature film entirely created using CGI. It was a groundbreaking achievement in animation and a huge success.**

* **Realistic Hair and Fur: Creating realistic hair and fur in CGI is a complex task. Pixar's "Monsters, Inc." (2001) was a milestone in CGI hair animation, showcasing incredibly detailed and lifelike fur.**

* **Water Simulation Challenges: Simulating realistic water in CGI is notoriously difficult and computationally intensive. The ocean scenes in movies like "Pirates of the Caribbean" and "The Perfect Storm" pushed the boundaries of water simulation technology.**

* **CGI in Food Commercials: Many food commercials use CGI to create mouth-watering images of food. The ice-cold condensation on a soda bottle or the sizzling cheese on a pizza is often computer-generated.**

* **Facial Motion Capture: CGI often uses facial motion capture to realistically animate characters' expressions and emotions. Actors wear markers on their faces that are tracked by cameras to capture their facial movements.**

* **Virtual Production: Advancements in CGI technology have led to virtual production techniques, where filmmakers can shoot scenes in a virtual environment, allowing for real-time visualization and interaction with CGI elements.**

* **Virtual Actors: CGI has made it possible to create virtual actors that closely resemble real humans. The character Gollum in "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy was a groundbreaking example of a CGI character interacting with live-action actors.**

* **Real-Time CGI in Video Games: Video game graphics have evolved tremendously, with modern games using real-time CGI to create stunning and immersive virtual worlds.**

* **Architectural Visualization: CGI is extensively used in architectural visualization, allowing architects and designers to create photorealistic renderings of buildings and spaces before construction begins.**

* **CGI in Medicine: Medical professionals use CGI for visualizations in areas like surgery simulation, anatomical education, and medical research.**

* **CGI Animals: CGI has become increasingly prevalent in bringing animals to life on screen. Movies like "The Jungle Book" and "The Lion King" used CGI to create realistic animal characters.**

* **The Uncanny Valley: The "uncanny valley" is a term used in CGI to describe the discomfort people feel when a computer-generated character looks almost human but falls slightly short, creating a sense of unease.**

* **Pre-Visualization: CGI is used in pre-visualization to plan and visualize complex scenes before filming. This helps filmmakers plan camera angles, action sequences, and special effects in advance.**

* **CGI in Advertising: CGI is widely used in advertising to create visually striking and attention-grabbing commercials for products and brands.**
